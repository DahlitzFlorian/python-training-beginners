# Write a password generator in Python.
# Be creative with how you generate passwords - strong passwords have a mix of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
# The passwords should be random, generating a new password every time the user asks for a new password.
# Include your run-time code in a main method.
